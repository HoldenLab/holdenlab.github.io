In this PhD project you will develop and apply smart microscopy tools to power the next generation of antibiotic drug discovery.</p> <p>First, you will improve the performance of bacterial high-throughput microscopy in a collaboration between the Holden lab at the University of Warwick and Cairn Research Ltd. This will include developing an open-source 96-well plate loader and integrating it with our new “RAPTOR” high-throughput super-resolution microscope. Then, you will use this instrument and deep learning analysis to 1) identify novel cell division proteins in Bacillus subtilis by genome-wide screening as potential targets of new anti-microbials and 2) to screen drug libraries for novel antimicrobial activity against Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. This exciting PhD project would equally suit an undergraduate or master student in physics, engineering or computer science with a strong interest in biology/ biomedicine, or a microbiologist, biochemist or biomedical scientist with a strong interest in engineering and quantitative biology.</p> <p>This fully funded four-year studentship is available for September 2026 to join Warwick’s MRC-funded Doctoral Training Partnership (MRC DTP). The program involves an exciting one-year MSc in Interdisciplinary Biomedical Research, followed by a three-year PhD project co-supervised by Professor Séamus Holden (School of Life Sciences) and Dr Sam Swift (Cairn Research Ltd UK). The successful candidate will join a dynamic DTP community, which includes advanced workshops, transferable skills training, careers support and cohort learning events and conferences with ~50 other students.</p> <p>We are constantly working to create a supportive and inclusive environment to help students achieve their best potential, through promoting equality and challenging discrimination. We want our students to feel heard and valued for their hard work. We welcome and encourage applications from minoritized groups that are under-represented in academia.</p> <p>For more details contact: <a href="seamus.Holden@warwick.ac.uk">seamus.Holden@warwick.ac.uk</a></p> <h2 id="supervisors">Supervisors</h2> <ul> <li>Professor Séamus Holden (University of Warwick)</li> <li>Dr Sam Swift (Cairn Research Ltd UK)</li> </ul> <h2 id="programme-content">PROGRAMME CONTENT</h2> <p>MSc (Year One) - The student will undertake a series of taught modules, including Frontier Techniques in Biomedical Research, Physical Biology of the Cell, Microscopy and Imaging, Mathematical Modelling, Mass Spectrometry, and two laboratory-based research projects.</p> <p>PhD (Years Two, Three and Four) - The student will then undertake a three-year interdisciplinary PhD project with supervisors from both Warwick University and an industry partner</p> <h2 id="student-support">Student support</h2> <p>Students receive outstanding mentoring, careers and pastoral support throughout the programme.</p> <h2 id="entry-requirements-funding-and-how-to-apply">ENTRY REQUIREMENTS, FUNDING AND HOW TO APPLY</h2> <p>Applications are open to home and international students.</p> <h3 id="entry-requirements">Entry requirements</h3> <p>Candidates must have an excellent undergraduate degree (2:1 or above) in the biological, physical or computational sciences and advanced skills in mathematics, statistics, physics or computer science (A-Level or international equivalent).
