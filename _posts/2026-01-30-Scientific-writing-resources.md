This is a short list of good writing resources for Holden lab members writing papers or theses. It may be useful to others too.

On writing papers:
- [Ten simple rules for structuring papers](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005619)
- [How to write a first-class paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-02404-4)

How to make good figures and figure legends:
- [Creating clear and informative image-based figures for scientific publications](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3001161)
- [The devil in the details (a short guide to writing figure legends)](https://totalinternalreflectionblog.com/2021/08/11/the-devil-in-the-details-a-short-guide-to-writing-figure-legends/)

I have previously written a [detailed post on scientific illustration](/blog/2024/scientific-illustration/)

Excellent book on general technical writing:
- [Zinsser, On Writing Well: The Classic Guide to Writing Non-Fiction](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Writing-Well-Classic-Guide-Non-Fiction/dp/0060006641)
There is a copy of Zinsser on my office bookshelf that may be borrowed .
