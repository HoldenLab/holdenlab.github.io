Over several years we have developed a method called Vertical Cell Imaging by Nanostructured Immobilization (VerCINI), together with the [Cees Dekker lab](https://ceesdekkerlab.nl/). It turns out that by immobilizing bacteria upright in nanofabricated cell traps, we can take much higher resolution images of any process organized along the cells short axis, especially bacterial cell wall synthesis.

To support other researchers in adopting this technology, we wrote a [detailed protocols paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41596-021-00668-1). We also teamed up with a nanofabrication company called ConScience, who can manufacture the silicon wafers required to make VerCINI cell traps, for modest price and without any profit to us. If you are interested in obtaining one of these wafers, please contact [Joachim Fritze at ConScience](jf@con-science.se).
