        am a Research Fellow in the Holden lab. My research focuses on understanding the role of teichoic acid polymers in establishing the pseudo-periplasm of Gram-positive bacteria, using a multidisciplinary approach that combines physics-based theory, simulations, and single-molecule experiments.

Prior to this, my work focused on the physical principles of chromatin organization and dynamics across different length scales and cell types. I received my PhD from IIT Bombay, where I studied nucleosome positioning and dynamics and their impact on DNA accessibility. I then joined the Institut Pasteur, Paris, as a postdoctoral researcher with Prof. Christophe Zimmer, where I expanded into genomics, bioinformatics, and polymer physics to model genome organization across species. Subsequently, as a DST-INSPIRE Faculty Fellow at NCBS, Bangalore, I studied transcriptional regulation in breast cancer cells using high-throughput image analysis. This fellowship also enabled a one-year visiting fellowship in the Holden lab.
