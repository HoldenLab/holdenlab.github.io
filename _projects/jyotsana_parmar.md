        I have joined the Holden Lab in early 2024 as a visiting research fellow. My main research focus here is to understand the properties of bacterial membranes using physics-based theory, simulations, and single molecule experiments. Before coming here, my main research interest has been in understanding the physical principles of chromatin organization and dynamics at different scales and in different cell types. I received my PhD from IIT Bombay, where I investigated nucleosome positioning and dynamics, and how it affects the accessibility of DNA. Later, I joined the Institut Pasteur, Paris as a postdoc with Prof. Christophe Zimmer, where I expanded into genomics, bioinformatics, and polymer physics, developing models to elucidate genome organization across different contexts and species. Currently, I am employed at NCBS, Bangalore as a DST Inspire faculty fellow.
