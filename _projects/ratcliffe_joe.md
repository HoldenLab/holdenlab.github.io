<br>
      
I'm a PhD student using advanced light microscopy, high throughput techniques and machine learning to study the mode of action of antibiotics with Bacterial Cytological Profiling. From 2018-2022 I studied for MSci in Natural Sciences at the University of Nottingham, specialising in maths, physics and biology.  During this time I completed a summer internship with the <a href="https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/research/groups/optics-and-photonics-research-group/index.aspx">Optics and Photonics Research Group</a> and my final year project at the <a href="https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/research/groups/spmic/index.aspx">Sir Peter Mansfield Imaging Centre </a> focused on using controlled destructive interference to reduce artifacts in MRI. I graduated with a first class degree was awarded the Natural Sciences MSci Prize 2022.
