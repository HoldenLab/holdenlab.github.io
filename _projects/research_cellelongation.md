How do cells grow? In rod shaped bacteria, bacteria grow by elongation, mostly using a protein complex call the elongasome. This protein complex is a target for established antibiotics such as the beta-lactams, and is a major target for next generation antimicrobials

We focus in particular on how the elongasome works as a nanoscale machine both *in vivo* and *in vitro*, and how cell size, shape and integrity is regulated by elongasome activity.

We use *Bacillus subtilis* and *Escherichia coli* as principal model organisms for these projects.

This work is primarily funded by the BBSRC.
