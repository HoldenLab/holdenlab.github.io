[Christoph Spahn's new paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-58723-4) on the organisation of the E. coli nucleoid is out in *Nature Communications*. He showed strong evidence that transertion, the coupled process of transcription, translation and membrane insertion, strongly attaches the nucleoid to the membrane during fast growth. Stuart Middlemiss from our lab contributed some nice VerCINI experiments to this study
