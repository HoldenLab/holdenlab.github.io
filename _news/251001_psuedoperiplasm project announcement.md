Good news! Our BBSRC grant proposal to study the physical basis of the enigmatic monoderm (Gram-positive) pseudo-periplasm has been funded. Jyotsana Parmar will be researcher-co-lead and PDRA on this 3 year project, staying on in the lab after joining last year as a visiting scientist. Looking forward to lots of collaborative working with Stansfeld (Warwick), Lowe (MRC-LMB), Winkler (Indiana) and Strahl (Newcastle) labs on this project.
