[Kateryna Nitsenko](https://holdenlab.github.io/projects/nitsenko_kateryna) (postdoctoral fellow) and [Jack Stone](https://holdenlab.github.io/projects/stone_jack) (senior research technician) joined the lab today. They will be both working on *in vitro* studies of the elongasome, one of the key protein complexes responsible for building the bacterial cell wall, in collaboration with the Roper and Stansfeld labs (Warwick), and Cochrane lab (Queens University Belfast).
